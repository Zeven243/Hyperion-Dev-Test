# Anagram Grouping Application

Welcome to the Anagram Grouping application. This application groups words that are anagrams of each other.

## Project Structure

The project has the following directory structure:

    ├── anagram.py
    ├── anagram_test.py
    └── README.md


- `anagram.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the solution for grouping anagrams.
- `anagram_test.py`: This file contains the tests for verifying the correctness of the solution.
- `README.md`: This file provides a description of the task and how to run the script.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `SectionA_CodeReview_Option_1` directory:
